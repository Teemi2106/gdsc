# Animation Fix - Disable Initial Animations on Page Load

## Problem

When the page loads, all elements animate into place before becoming normal, causing a jarring user experience.

## Solution

Modify the `useInViewAnimation` hook to start with `isInView: true` so elements appear immediately in their final position.

## Steps

- [x] Create TODO.md to track progress
- [x] Modify `src/hooks/useInViewAnimation.ts` to start with `isInView: true`
- [ ] Test the changes to ensure elements appear immediately
- [ ] Verify hover and interaction animations still work
- [ ] Check mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Test accessibility features
